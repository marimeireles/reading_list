## 📚 Adding a Reading List Page to My Own Website

Here are the steps to make this work on your website:

1. 📋 Copy the files `books_js.js` and `books.html` to your website folder
2. 📝 Edit the file `your_csv_address.js` to contain your `.csv` file address
   (I recommend hosting it on Github, but feel free to use any other hosting service)
3. 🎉 Congrats! Your website should now have a cool new page with your own books! Just navigate to your-website.com/books.html.

If you run into any issues, don't hesitate to open an issue here! 😊

## 📖 How Should My CSV Look?

Check out the [test.csv](test.csv) file in this repository. Everything should be separated by commas, but make sure to separate your type labels with `;` instead of commas. Happy reading! 🤓
